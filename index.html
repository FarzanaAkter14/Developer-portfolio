        <p>I felt really happy to be able to film together with Korea's most beautiful actress. Everyone thinks it's because of her outward appearance that Song Hye-kyo became famous, but after working together, I realized her inner heart and personality are also good. Moreover, she has lots of acting experience, and I actually did learn a lot from her.</p>
